Game mechanics implemented:
	doors, riddles needed to be solved to advance, movement, drawing the map, timer, fps counter,
	lose condition on timeout
Target audience: mid teens

Proposed deveolopment schedule of when key milestones will be achieved:
	We would give each other tasks after every lesson to complete
	before we met up in the next lesson, if they were not completed 
	we would assist eachother and/or ask the teacher for help, then hand
	out the next set of tasks, this gave us the ability to do things 1 step at
	a time and have less to worry about completing every lesson.
This is a link for TRELLO that we were using when we would complete a task:
